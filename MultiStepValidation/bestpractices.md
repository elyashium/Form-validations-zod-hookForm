Navigate between steps (Next/Back)

Validate each step before moving forward

Show progress (breadcrumbs or step indicators)

Store form data across steps

Final submission with full form data validation



In React Hook Form, the best combo is:

Use conditional rendering to keep only 1 step mounted.

Wrap form in a FormProvider so state is retained across steps.

Use .trigger() to validate only visible fields before navigating.

Optionally save data to a parent state or useReducer if you want global control.

Add visual breadcrumbs / progress indicators separately.


all steps mounted (display: none)

or with conditional rendering and persistent state handling.
